This folder contains the QE curves for each of the sensors in the
simulated LSSTComCam instrument, LSSTComCamSim.  Since we do not have
reliable laboratory QE curves available for the CCDs in ComCam, we
have used the QE curve data from the R42 ITL raft in LSSTCam.

Data Processing
---------------

The per-CCD QE data here are copies of the QE curve data for ITL raft
R42 in lsstCam as added in DM-40164.  The detector numbers and raft
name have been edited in those files to correspond to the ComCam
values.
