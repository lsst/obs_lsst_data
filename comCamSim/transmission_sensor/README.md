==========
The per-CCD QE data here are copies of the QE curve data for ITL raft
R42 in lsstCam as added in DM-40164.  Since there are no comparable
lab measurements of the QE curves for the CCDs in ComCam, we're using
the data from one of the ITL rafts in lsstCam for the simulated comCamSim
instrument.
