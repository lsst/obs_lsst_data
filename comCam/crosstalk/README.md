Estimated crosstalk coefficients for ComCam, `c0` and `c1`. The latter is the non-linear term.
The coefficients are estimated from the average of all the ITL sensor measurements for LsstCam in obs_lsst_data.
The script to make these crosstalk tables can be run with:
`python $OBS_LSST_DIR/python/lsst/obs/lsst/script/write_comcam_estimated_non_linear_crosstalk_coeffs.py`
